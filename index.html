      <h2>What is E-Waste?</h2>
      <p>E-waste (electronic waste) includes any discarded electronic devices with a plug or battery. It is a growing waste stream as consumers replace phones, computers, and appliances quickly. 62 million tonnes of e-waste were generated globally in 2022 [oai_citation:16‡unitar.org](https://unitar.org/about/news-stories/press/global-e-waste-monitor-2024-electronic-waste-rising-five-times-faster-documented-e-waste-recycling#:~:text=20%20March%202024%2C%20Geneva%20%2F,report%20from%20ITU%20and%20UNITAR), making it a major environmental concern. E-waste often contains toxic materials (lead, mercury, cadmium) that can harm health and the environment [oai_citation:17‡ewastemonitor.info](https://ewastemonitor.info/the-global-e-waste-monitor-2024/#:~:text=E,human%20brain%20and%20coordination%20system).</p>
    </section>

    <section id="causes-sources">
      <h2>Causes and Sources</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Rapid technology turnover: Frequent device upgrades lead to more discarded electronics each year [oai_citation:18‡weee-forum.org](https://weee-forum.org/ws_news/international-e-waste-day-2021/#:~:text=Global%20e,lifecycles%20and%20limited%20repair%20options).</li>
        <li>High consumption: Growing global demand for gadgets (smartphones, laptops, TVs) drives waste volumes [oai_citation:19‡ewastemonitor.info](https://ewastemonitor.info/the-global-e-waste-monitor-2024/#:~:text=Challenges%20contributing%20to%20the%20widening,waste%20management%20infrastructure).</li>
        <li>Short product lifecycles: Limited repair and long-term use options mean old devices become obsolete quickly [oai_citation:20‡ewastemonitor.info](https://ewastemonitor.info/the-global-e-waste-monitor-2024/#:~:text=Challenges%20contributing%20to%20the%20widening,waste%20management%20infrastructure).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Key sources include households and businesses discarding old appliances, IT equipment, and consumer electronics. Globally, Asia, Europe, and the Americas generate the majority of e-waste by volume [oai_citation:21‡ewastemonitor.info](https://ewastemonitor.info/gem-2020/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20report%2C%20Asia,enough%20to%20form%20a%20line).</p>
    </section>

    <section id="impacts">
      <h2>Environmental and Health Impacts</h2>
      <p>E-waste often ends up in landfills or is informally recycled, releasing hazardous substances. For example, burning circuit boards or melting plastics emits toxic fumes. Mercury from screens and lead from batteries can contaminate soil and water, damaging ecosystems and human health [oai_citation:22‡ewastemonitor.info](https://ewastemonitor.info/the-global-e-waste-monitor-2024/#:~:text=E,human%20brain%20and%20coordination%20system). Formal e-waste recycling (which recovers metals safely) is limited: as of 2022, only about 22% of e-waste was properly collected and recycled [oai_citation:23‡unitar.org](https://unitar.org/about/news-stories/press/global-e-waste-monitor-2024-electronic-waste-rising-five-times-faster-documented-e-waste-recycling#:~:text=Meanwhile%2C%20less%20than%20one%20quarter,battery%2C%20is%20a%20health%20and). The rest often enters landfill or illegal dumps, where pollutants can accumulate. These practices contribute to air and water pollution, threatening nearby communities.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="disposal-methods">
      <h2>Current Disposal Methods</h2>
      <p>Most e-waste is discarded via landfill or informal sectors, especially in developing countries. Only a fraction goes through formal recycling or refurbishment. For example, in the EU (2018) roughly 55% of e-waste was collected for recycling, while the rest was lost [oai_citation:24‡weee-forum.org](https://weee-forum.org/ws_news/international-e-waste-day-2021/#:~:text=By%20weight%2C%20discarded%20big%20appliances,the%20WEEE%20Forum%20in%20a). Globally, improper disposal is common. Some electronics are exported to countries with lax regulations, where informal dismantling happens without safety measures. This underlines the need for better disposal infrastructure.</p>

    <section id="management-strategies">
      <h2>E-Waste Management Strategies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Legislation and EPR:</strong> Many countries have enacted e-waste laws. As of 2023, 81 countries had specific e-waste regulations, often mandating manufacturer responsibility for recycling [oai_citation:25‡unitar.org](https://unitar.org/about/news-stories/press/global-e-waste-monitor-2024-electronic-waste-rising-five-times-faster-documented-e-waste-recycling#:~:text=%2A%2081%20countries%20had%20e,legislation%2C%20and%20regulation%20%E2%80%9Cremains%20a).</li>
        <li><strong>Recycling Programs:</strong> Establishing more recycling centers and take-back schemes helps collect devices for material recovery.</li>
        <li><strong>Public Awareness:</strong> Educating consumers to recycle old electronics and designing products for repair/ reuse.</li>
        <li><strong>Global Targets:</strong> The UN reports that increasing collection/recycling rates to 60% by 2030 would bring net benefits (over US$38 billion saved) [oai_citation:26‡unitar.org](https://unitar.org/about/news-stories/press/global-e-waste-monitor-2024-electronic-waste-rising-five-times-faster-documented-e-waste-recycling#:~:text=The%20report%20underlines%20that%20if,mobility). Higher recycling also reduces mining needs and pollution.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These strategies aim to close the loop on electronic materials and mitigate health/environmental impacts.</p>
